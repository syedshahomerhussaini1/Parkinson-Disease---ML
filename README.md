### 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning models based on biomedical voice measurements.
The goal is to assist in early detection of Parkinson’s Disease by analyzing patterns in patient data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech.
Early diagnosis is critical but challenging.

In this project, we:

Use machine learning algorithms to classify patients

Analyze voice-related biomedical features

Predict whether a person has Parkinson’s Disease or not

## 🎯 Objectives

Preprocess and analyze Parkinson’s dataset

Train ML models for disease prediction

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and metrics

Build a reliable prediction system

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed (3.8+ recommended).

Install required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

▶️ Run the Notebook
jupyter notebook


Open:

parkinson_disease.ipynb


Run all cells sequentially.

## 📈 Results

The trained machine learning model achieves high accuracy in predicting Parkinson’s Disease.

SVM generally performs best for this dataset.

The model can effectively distinguish between healthy individuals and Parkinson’s patients.

🧪 Sample Prediction

The model can take patient feature values as input and predict:

Parkinson’s Disease detected

No Parkinson’s Disease detected
